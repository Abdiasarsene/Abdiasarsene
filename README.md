## 📧 About Me

I have a weakness for everything related to IT professions and for a long time, I wondered how to reconcile this strong love with my own nature. I don't like to appear that way, but I don't want to be that coder who just eats lines of code. I want to be proud to write thousands of lines and know in petto that these lines of code will be useful for something. This is how I decided to intervene as an **IT Consultant** in sectors such as humanitarian, health, marketing, banking and insurance, sociology and even psychology, helping companies, international organizations and humanitarian agencies to fully exploit the potential of their data and create innovative web solutions. My ability to combine rigorous analysis and technical creativity allows me to design tailor-made solutions that perfectly meet the specific needs of each project.
